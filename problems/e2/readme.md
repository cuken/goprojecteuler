# [Problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

Even Fibonacci numbers

`Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.`

## Thought Process

The Fibonacci sequence might come up in future problems, so I'm going to create a method in [ProjectEulerHelper] that will return an int of a fibonacci number that can recursively call itself to grow.

I'll then itterate over that value to make sure `value % 2 == 0` and if it does add it to the sum.

This number could be very large so we might need to start toying with breaking super large numbers up in Go.

This [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6878590/the-maximum-value-for-an-int-type-in-go) article shows the upper limit of interger types within go. Our number should fall beneath that, but it is something to consider for future problems.

To be safe, we'll use uint64 to provide the greatest range of supported numbers.
