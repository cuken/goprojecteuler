# Go Project Euler

Go Project Euler is a repository that stores my GO solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

I've solved many of the beggining problems in C#, but wanted to get a better understanding of [GO](https://golang.org/).
I'm redoing all the previous problems I've solved and working on new ones.

For historcal reference, I'm going to copy the instructions from each of the problems and link directly to it within each folder.
If you have any desire to help, or want to discuss a specific solution, please submit an issue or a pull request.
