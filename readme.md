# Go Project Euler

Go Project Euler is a repository that stores my GO solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

I've solved many of the beggining problems in C#, but wanted to get a better understanding of [GO](https://golang.org/).
I'm redoing all the previous problems I've solved and working on new ones.

For historcal reference, I'm going to copy the instructions from each of the problems and link directly to it within each folder.

*SPOILERS* Reading the E#.go code will reveal the solution and how I solved it. Please start with the readme and see if the concept for the solution is enough to get you to solve it alone. I'll include a solution directory in each project folder with the output of the program.

## Problem Folders

Folders are labeled E# where # = the project euler archived problem number.
Each folder will have a document outlining the thought process and the coresponding code that tries to execute said process.

## Goals

- Get better at GO
- Use brute force as a last option
- Try to have the solution complete fast. (fast is relative, but where I can optimize, I should).
- Create crazy comments so others can learn, and I can review the thought process in the future.
- Test? Maybe for the RFL.

## Repetitive Functions Library

I'm going to make a package that does simple functions that repeat for multiple problems. (e.g. Finding if a number is prime). 

## Problems Solved

None yet! Lets do this!!!

## Help

If you have any desire to help, or want to discuss a specific solution, please submit an issue or a pull request.
Additionally, please take a look at the repetitive functions package that is used in the projects when needed. I'm sure a lot of the functions can be optimized.
I would appreciate help in learning the "proper" go way of doing things, as well as a better mathematical methods of solving problems.
